The goal of `geocoder` is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version of `geocoder` like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("alarm-redist/geocoder")
```

## Example

``` r
library(geocoder)
## basic example code
```

## Cache

Downloads will go to `options(geocoder.cache_dir)` if it is set. If it
is not, and `options(geocoder.use_cache = TRUE)`, downloads will be
cached between sessions in `rappdirs::user_cache_dir("geocoder")`. If If
`options(geocoder.use_cache = FALSE)` (the default), then the cache will
be in a temporary directory that does not persist between sessions. You
can check the size of the cache and clear it with `gc_cache_size()` and
`gc_cache_clear()`.
